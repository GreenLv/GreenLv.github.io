I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), advised by [Prof. Gaogang Xie](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~_xie?language=en) and [Prof. Zhenyu Li](https://zhenyulee.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2016. My research interests lie in video streaming, network transport protocol, and Internet measurements.
